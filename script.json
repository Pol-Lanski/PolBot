  "LANGUAGES": "I speak as many languages as Pol (or I will, once he's programmed me in all languages), and those are Catalan, Spanish, French and, well, English, as you might have noticed.\n He has done some incursions in Chinese, Hindi and Thai, but don't believe him if he says he can keep a conversation in those languages."
